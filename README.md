## 🔷 Overview

The **StormVerse Data Repository** is the central hub for structured environmental intelligence data fueling the StormWater AI and StormVerse ecosystems. This repository stores all raw inputs, geospatial overlays, AI-generated metadata, seismic intelligence, weather signals, and SWPPP-related compliance files.

It is directly integrated into:
- StormWater Intelligence Platform (v3.4+)
- ARCSEC-verified endpoints
- AI agents (OpenAI, Claude, internal MITO/ODIN)
- NOAA, FEMA, EPA live data sources
- CesiumJS-based 3D mapping dashboard
- KMZ/KML editors and site reporting tools
